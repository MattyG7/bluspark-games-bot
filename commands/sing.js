    "**Over You**\n\nNow that it's all said and done\nI can't believe you were the one\nTo build me up and tear me down\nLike an old abandoned house\nWhat you said when you left\nJust left me cold and out of breath\nI felt as if I was in way to deep\nGuess I let you get the best of me",
    "**You Belong With Me**\n\nYou're on the phone with your girlfriend\nShe's upset\nShe's going off about something that you said\n'Cause she doesn't get your humour like I do\nI'm in my room\nIt's a typical Tuesday night\nI'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like\nAnd she'll never know your story like I do'",
    "**We Are One**\n\nIf there's so much I must be, can I still just be me the way I am?\nCan I trust in my own heart or am I just one part of some big plan?",
    "**Dry Your Eyes**\n\nDry your eyes mate\nI know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up\nThere's plenty more fish in the sea\nDry your eyes mate\nI know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts but you've got to walk away now, it's over.",

    "**What About Now**\n\nWhat about now?\nWhat about today?\nWhat if you're making me all that I was meant to be?\nWhat if our love never went away?\nWhat if it's lost behind words we could never find?\nBaby, before it's too late,\nWhat about now?",
    "**Hear You Me**\n\nThere's no one in town I know\nYou gave us some place to go\nI never said thank you for that\nI thought I might get one more chance\nWhat would you think of me now\nSo lucky, So strong, So proud?\nI never said thank you for that\nNow I'll never have a chance",
    "**Give Yourself A Try**\n\nYou learn a couple things when you get to my age\nLike friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark\nWhen your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times\nYou're getting spiritually enlightened at 29\nSo just give yourself a try",
    "**A Million Dreams**\n\nI close my eyes and I can see\nThe world that's waiting up for me\nThat I call my own\nThrough the dark, through the door\nThrough where no one's been before\nBut it feels like home",
    "**A Million Dreams**\n\n'Cause every night I lie in bed\nThe brightest colors fill my head\nA million dreams are keeping me awake\nI think of what the world could be\nA vision of the one I see\nA million dreams is all it's gonna take\nA million dreams for the world we're gonna make",
    "**A Million Dreams**\n\nThere's a house we can build\nEvery room inside is filled\nWith things from far away\nSpecial things I compile\nEach one there to make you smile\nOn a rainy day",

    "**Can You Feel The Love Tonight (Movie Version)**\n\nI can see what's happening\nWhat?\nAnd they don't have a clue\nWho?\nThey'll fall in love and here's the bottom line, our trio's down to two\nOh\nThe sweet caress of twilight, there's magic everywhere\nAnd with all this romantic atmosphere disaster's in the air",
    "**Forever Young**\n\nLet's dance in style, let's dance for a while\nHeaven can wait we're only watching the skies\nHoping for the best, but expecting the worst\nAre you gonna drop the bomb or not?",
    "**Disco 2000**\n\nAnd I said let's all meet up in the year 2000\nWon't it be strange when we're all fully grown\nBe there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road\nI never knew that you'd get married\nI would be living down here on my own\nOn that damp and lonely Thursday years ago",
    "**Always**\n\nNow I can't sing a love song\nLike the way it's meant to be\nWell I guess I'm not that good anymore\nBut baby, that's just me\nYeah, I will love you baby\nAlways and I'll be there\nForever and a day, always\nI'll be there till the stars don't shine\n'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme\nI know when I die you'll be on my mind\nAnd I'll love you, always",
    "**Angels**\n\nAnd through it all she offers me protection\nA lot of love and affection\nWhether I'm right or wrong\nAnd down the waterfall\nWherever it may take me\nI know that life won't break me\nWhen I come to call, she won't forsake me\nI'm loving angels instead",
    "**Torn**\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel, I'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nWide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late\nI'm already torn",
    "**Chasing Cars**\n\nIf I lay here\nIf I just lay here\nWould you lay with me and just forget the world?",
    "**Huh?**\n\nI've lost my voice! Try again.",
    "**When You Say Nothing At All**\n\nThe smile on your face let's me know that you need me\nThere's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me\nThe touch of your hand says you'll catch me if wherever I fall\nYou say it best when you say nothing at all",
    "**A Little Respect**\n\nI try to discover\nA little something to make me sweeter\nOh baby refrain from breaking my heart\nI'm so in love with you\nI'll be forever blue\nThat you gimme no reason\nWhy you make me work so hard\nThat you gimme no\nThat you gimme no\nThat you gimme no\nThat you gimme no\nSoul, I hear you calling\nOh baby please give a little respect to me",
    "**Still I Fly**\n\nThere's a time in your life\nWhen the world is on your side\nYou might not feel it\nYou might not see it\nBut it surrounds you like a light\nMakes you stronger for the fight\nNever letting go\nGotta learn to grow\nWatch me as I touch the sky\nStill I fly\nNow I know it's what I gotta do\nFind a dream that's new\nGive it all I got this time\nStill I fly\nStill I fly",
    "**May I**\n\nThere you stand, opened heart, opened doors\nFull of life with a world that's wanting more\nBut I can see when the lights start to fade\nThe day is done and your smile has gone away\nLet me raise you up\nLet me be your love\nMay I hold you as you fall to sleep\nWhen the world is closing in\nAnd you can't breathe\nMay I love you, may I be your shield\nWhen no one can be found\nMay I lay you down",
    "**My Most Precious Treasure**\n\nI'll go anywhere, I promise\nWith these things that you have taught me\nIn the tears so brightly shining\nI'll save happiness and our dreams\nEven if we're seperated\nI will bear the pain and carry on\nRise again to see the morning\nLive for you forevermore",
    "**Brave Song**\n\nI've always been walking along this lonely path\nAnd when I turned around, everyone was far behind me\nNevertheless I keep on walking and walking\nTo show what memory of strength was\nNothing in this world scares me anymore\nBut that's a lie I keep whispering\nEveryone will be alone someday, believe me\nAnd they will live on memories which can be so sad but\nThey've made me feel love and alive feeling when I'm so lonely\nI will fight for my dear full of happiness\nAnd I will laugh, so shall them, cry no more tears",
    "**Palm Of A Tiny Hand**\n\nFar away, far away\nI hear the wind gently caress the fields\nI walked along this empty road\nSearching for pieces of our fond memories\nEverything sad, can we forget?\nAll the moments that have led us here\nI still remember them\nAnd I always will\nIn this tiny hand of yours\nI know there is the strength\nThat will someday surely surpass our own\nAfter all the tears I've shed\nBeneath the ripe grapes\nI got up to carry on\nEven if my hand is small and we are far apart\nI reach out for you and we will walk this road\nAll the precious memories will stay in our hearts\nIf one day you choose to go",
    "**Zenzenzense**\n\nAt last, hello, you've opened your eyes\nBut, why won't you even look me in the eyes, what's wrong with you?\nYou angrily tell me that I‚Äôm late\nWell, I'm sorry, but I did my best and running at my fastest pace\nMy heart overtook my body as it flew to find you in this place\nSeeing your hair flowing and your bright eyes glowing aches my very core\nWish I could breathe in the same dimension, I don't want to let it go\nNow that I am finally faced with the voice I've known for so long\nI don't know what the words should be the very first I say to you\nBack in the Zenzenzense 'til this day\nBeen looking everywhere for you\nI followed the sound of your innocent laughter\nAnd it guided me in the right way\nEven if every piece of you disappeared\nAnd if it scattered everywhere\nNo, I won't waver, I'll start back at one\nLook for you all over again\nOr maybe instead I'll take the whole universe\nRight back to zero again"];
